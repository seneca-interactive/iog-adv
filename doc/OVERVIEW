proposed ideas / planned features (public)

=========================================

  Mark supported ideas by * and un-
  supported ideas by / within the
  specified field ([ ]).

  If a mark already resides in the
  field, simply add a second mark
  in the field

  If you have no opinion, leave the
  field blank.

  // Each developer may only mark
  // one * or / per item.

  Mark items you have already gone
  to lengths to implement by ~.

=========================================

  // Core Game
  // the rest of the game will be developed around
  // these basic assumptions. Therefore, these are
  // the most immediately important to establish,
  // even if they are not immediately implemented

  [*] Luck Attribute

[ *] Mana (regenerating)
[**] Mana-restore potions in-game
[*/] Mana (regenerating) with consumable items used for powerful spells
  ()[*]Consumable items only used for 'legendary,' spells which would
       near-impossible to cast more than once or twice a playthrough
       (like masterball function in pokemon, but KO) Requires good
       spellcasting skills.
[//] No Mana and consumable items used for all spells
[**] Stamina
  [*] Endurance (gives very small bonuses to all physical attributes and
                increases stamina)



[ ] Leveling system (overall level)
[**] Leveling system (individual levels)
[ ] Leveling system (individual levels and calculated overall level by
    skills)
[ ] Leveling system (individual levels and calculated overall level by
    attributes)

  // Gear + Gear-stats

[~] All defensive gear has def and armor stats
  [ *] Def and Armor stats calculated from equipped armor //In addition to attributes
[~] All weapons have min + max and modifiers for att, str, and crit
[//] All weapons have only min + max
[//] All weapons and armor weigh you down by a certain minor amount,
    thus decreasing stamina regen or making stamina not as powerful
    as raw level value. This value changes depending on the item.
 // If we did this, we would have to do it for all items, and it overall would be annoying and not add much worth imo.
